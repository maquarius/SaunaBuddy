# SaunaBuddy
My final project for the course IoT Experimental Project at Haaga-Helia. It shows the humidity and the temperature of the sauna over wifi, so you don't need to go there to check if it is hot enough.  Initially, the idea was that you could also throw on water remotely so that the sauna has the right humidity.

# About SaunaBuddy
My final project for the course IoT Experimental Project at Haaga-Helia. It shows the humidity and the temperature of the sauna over wifi, so you don't need to go there to check if it is hot enough.  Initially, the idea was that you could also throw on water remotely so that the sauna has the right humidity. It weas my first experience with Arduino and C++.

## Made with
Made on an ESP32, a hdc1080 digital humidity sensor and a basic servo.

## Example
A video example on youtube of [Sauna buddy](https://youtu.be/dDuj645vdRg).

##Future
Since working so closely with sensore, i will continue this project. Estimated begin date: May 2021
 - [ ] improving the way of interraction with the webserver. Now only one client at the time.
 - [ ] Improve the interface of the webserver to display data better and generally better looking
 - [ ] research how saunaproof the hardware is and make it saunaproof
 - [ ] implement the project in my own sauna.
 - [ ] add a fire watcher, to see if the fire is still going
 - [ ] find out a way to use the servo to throw water on the rocks.
